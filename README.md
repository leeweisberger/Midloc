# Midloc

Midloc is a lightweight app that helps friends who live far from one another find convenient places to meet. 
Deriving it's name from "middle" and "location", Midloc quickly lists out restaurants and other points of interest equidistant from you and your friend based on zip code and let's you share it and navigate to it. 
Currently powered by Google Places API.
